# JavaCardGame - Diamond Forest Card Game

## Overview

Diamond Forest is an original Czech card game where players take on the roles of dwarves 
venturing into a dark forest in search of 4 diamonds. 
The game is played on a variable game board composed of tiles representing the dark forest. 
These tiles are gradually revealed, with some remaining hidden. 
Each tile has its own effect triggered when a player steps on it. 
The game involves elements of memory combined with player decision-making, 
as players must decide whether to take risks or choose a safer path.

## Project Details

This project was created as part of my university EBC-PJ - Java Programming Language course. 
It demonstrates my knowledge of Java programming, including object-oriented programming and 
graphical user interface development using JavaFX. 
Maven was used for project management, 
and Scene Builder was employed for designing the game's graphical user interface.
